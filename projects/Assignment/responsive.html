				<h3>Fluid grid</h3>
		
			<!--answers goes here-->
		<content>	
			<p>
			Responsive web design can be done either by  fixed design, or Fluid grid. Most of the time, fluid grid is preferred because it is easier to apply .
			</p>
			
			<p>Fluid grid is a way of styling a website layout so that it becomes adaptive to any kind of devices that it is going to be accessed with.
			It makes elements of the website flow.
			
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>How Fluid grid works</h3>
			<p>Fluid grids uses a percentage based method of structuring a website unlike the fixed ones which uses pixels to design the layout. Every sections have to be divided neatly so that it can be easy to manipulate and must be assigned with a maximum width. Then, we design each and every element from the perspective of the device it is going to viewed with. That's where the media query come in handy. </p>
			<h3>How to handle images in different screen sizes</h3>
			<p>There are a ton of factors when it comes to implementing responsive images. One of these factors is dealing with the bandwidth. Developers started to provide different images based on the device browser width. </p><p>This is called adaptive design. It allows a mobile phone to download a smaller image file than the full resolution one that is accessed on a desktop monitor. Moreover, another way of handling the images to fit several screen sizes is fixing problems with aspect ratio. Similar to the way that the bandwidth issue is handled, services like Picturefill also allow websites to serve up different images based on the device's screen width.</p><p> However, unlike Adaptive design, Picturefill allows the developer to specify specific sources for each circumstance, so, So a mobile device with a 320px screen width will be served a specialized image that can be custom cropped for best application. These techniques are effective ways to have control over exactly which images are displayed for each device scenario.</p>
			<h3>The role of CSS3 Media Query in responsive design</h3>
			<p>Media queries are extensions to CSS3 that make us more in control over rendering for several devices. CSS3 Media Query allows us nowadays to change the website layout to suit the needs of different devices browsers without changing anything in the content of our website, and this is what can make our website responsively designed.</p>
